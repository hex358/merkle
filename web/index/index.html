<b>CertumTree</b> is a zero-trust data verification system that protects against digital fraud and forgery. Register any digital object through our API and distinguish authentic from fabricated later with cryptographic proof. Built on blockchain for immutable, transparent verification of messages, files, and documents.

    <h2 class="section-title">How CertumTree Works</h2>
    <p class="service-description">
      CertumTree is a <b>zero-trust data verification layer</b> designed to prevent tampering and fraud.
      When a digital object - such as a message, file, or transaction - is registered through the API,
      it is reduced to a cryptographic hash. The system never stores the raw content,
      only these hashes, which act as irreversible digital fingerprints.
    </p><br>
    <p class="service-description">
      All hashes are organized into an <b>append-only Merkle Mountain Range</b>,
      ensuring that once a record is added, it cannot be modified or deleted.
      Each new insertion extends the chain of proofs while preserving the full history of prior states.
    </p><br>
    <p class="service-description">
      To guarantee transparency, <b>root hashes</b> - the condensed representation of the entire dataset -
      are publicly available. This allows independent auditors or third parties to confirm
      that no hidden modifications occurred between checkpoints.
    </p><br>
    <p class="service-description">
      Under the hood, CertumTree is powered by a custom high-performance key-value engine,
      derived from LMDB - <b>HexDB</b>. HexDB is optimized for millions of inserts per second,
      enabling CertumTree to handle large-scale verification workloads without sacrificing speed or consistency.
    </p><br>
    <p class="service-description">
      The result is a system where authenticity can be proven <b>both ways</b>:
      services can issue cryptographic proofs of integrity, and clients can
      independently validate them without relying on trust in a central authority.
    </p><br>
      <p class="service-description">
  The <b>CertumTree API</b> makes integration straightforward. Applications can register new records,
  request inclusion proofs, and verify data integrity with just a few endpoints.
  Designed to be lightweight and stateless, the API can be embedded into existing systems with minimal effort,
  enabling real-time verification for messages, documents, financial transactions, or any other digital objects.
</p><br>
      <p class="service-description">
  The project is fully <b>open source</b> under the permissive <b>MIT license</b>,
  encouraging community contributions, transparency, and independent adoption.
  Many new features and improvements (such as WebRTC support for even faster verifications) will continue to be added as the ecosystem grows.
